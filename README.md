## ü§î Why Hands-On-Python ?

As someone who has gone through the programming learning journey, I understand the challenges that beginners often face when studying and trying to grasp various concepts, especially in Python. This project is designed for individuals who are just starting to learn Python and are exploring GitHub as potential contributors.

## üöÄ Contribution Guide

_Here is the step-by-step **Beginner's Guide** on how a beginner can contribute to our GitHub repository_

<details>
<summary>
Step 1: Star The Repo
</summary>
Give a star to this repo. Your support means a lot to us.

<details>
<summary>
Step 2: Fork the Repository
</summary>

Now click on the **"Fork"** button in the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

</details>
<details>
<summary>
Step 3: Clone the Forked Repository
</summary>

Next, you'll need to clone the forked repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command, replacing `your-username` with your GitHub username:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Step 4: Create a New Branch
</summary>

It's a good practice to create a new branch for your contribution. This helps keep your changes separate from the main codebase. In your terminal, navigate to the cloned repository and run the following command to create a new branch:

Give branch name according to you, it should be related to you changes. Here we have taken name **my-contribution** for example

```
git checkout -b my-contribution
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>
Step 5: Commit and Push Your 
</summary>

Once you've finished your changes, it's time to commit and push your changes to your forked repository. In the terminal, run the following commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"
git push origin my-contribution
```

This will stage your changed files, create a commit with a descriptive message, and push your branch to your forked repository.

**Note**: `git add .` stage all your changed file, for any specific file write it's full name, like `git add my_file.py`

</details>
<details>
<summary>
Step 6: Create a Pull Request
</summary>

The final step is to create a pull request. Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the **"Compare & pull request"** button. This will take you to the pull request page, where you can add a title and description for your contribution. 

Review the information and click **"Create pull request"** to submit your contribution for review by the project maintainers.

Congratulations! You've successfully contributed to a GitHub repository by creating a new Markdown file. Remember to follow the project's contribution guidelines and be patient as the maintainers review your pull request.
