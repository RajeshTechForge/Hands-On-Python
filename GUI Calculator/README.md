This repository houses the Python code for a delightful and easy-to-use GUI calculator, expertly crafted using the Tkinter library. It presents a visually appealing and intuitive interface that seamlessly basic mathematical operations.

# Features

- **Simple design:** Enjoy a user-friendly GUI that strikes a balance between aesthetics and ease of use.
- **Comprehensive functionality:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and more with confidence.
- **Clear input and output:** Easily enter calculations and view results in a well-formatted manner.
- **Error handling:** Gracefully handle invalid input and potential calculation errors.

#  Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 (I hope it would run on newer versions)
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)

# Installation

1. Clone or download the repository

2. If Tkinter is not installed, use pip to install it:

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```
3. If you want to use ttkthemes

      ```bash
   pip install ttkthemes
   ```
      
**Note:** Using virtual environment is always recommended

# Running the Calculator

1. Navigate to the project directory:
2. Run the main Python script: `python GUI_Calculator.py`

This will launch the GUI calculator on your screen.

# Usage

The calculator has a straightforward interface. Enter your calculations using:

- Numerical buttons (0-9)
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, **, //)
- Parentheses for order of operations
- Equal sign (=) to display the result
- Clear button (C) to clear the current input

# Customization

Feel free to experiment with the code in `GUI_Calculator.py` to personalize the look and feel of the calculator. However, exercise caution, as modifying core logic might affect functionality.

# Contributions

I encourage you to contribute to this project! Share your ideas, improvements, improving GUI design or bug reports by opening an issue or pull request.
